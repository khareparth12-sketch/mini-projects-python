# 🐍 Mini Python Projects

A curated collection of **18 mini Python projects** built while learning and practicing Python fundamentals and intermediate concepts.

This repository is designed as a **clean learning archive**, showcasing hands-on problem solving through small, focused projects rather than a single large application.

## ▶️ How to Run a Project

Each project has its **own entry Python file**, named according to what the project does.

### Steps:

```bash
cd project-folder-name
python filename.py
```

### Example

```bash
cd 01-quiz-game
python quiz-game.py
```

- ⚠️ There is no universal main.py. Each project runs independently.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

+ Language: Python
+ Skill Level: Beginner → Intermediate
+ Libraries:

- Python Standard Library
- External libraries where required (project-specific)
